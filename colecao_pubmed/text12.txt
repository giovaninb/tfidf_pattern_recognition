Deep learning for computational biology.

Technological advances in genomics and imaging have led to an explosion of
molecular and cellular profiling data from large numbers of samples. This rapid
increase in biological data dimension and acquisition rate is challenging
conventional analysis strategies. Modern machine learning methods, such as deep
learning, promise to leverage very large data sets for finding hidden structure
within them, and for making accurate predictions. In this review, we discuss
applications of this new breed of analysis approaches in regulatory genomics and 
cellular imaging. We provide background of what deep learning is, and the
settings in which it can be successfully applied to derive biological insights.
In addition to presenting specific applications and providing tips for practical 
use, we also highlight possible pitfalls and limitations to guide computational
biologists when and how to make the most use of this new technology.
