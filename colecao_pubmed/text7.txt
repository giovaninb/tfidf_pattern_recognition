Sequence-specific bias correction for RNA-seq data using recurrent neural
networks.

BACKGROUND: The recent success of deep learning techniques in machine learning
and artificial intelligence has stimulated a great deal of interest among
bioinformaticians, who now wish to bring the power of deep learning to bare on a 
host of bioinformatical problems. Deep learning is ideally suited for biological 
problems that require automatic or hierarchical feature representation for
biological data when prior knowledge is limited. In this work, we address the
sequence-specific bias correction problem for RNA-seq data redusing Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) to model nucleotide sequences without pre-determining
sequence structures. The sequence-specific bias of a read is then calculated
based on the sequence probabilities estimated by RNNs, and used in the estimation
of gene abundance.
RESULT: We explore the application of two popular RNN recurrent units for this
task and demonstrate that RNN-based approaches provide a flexible way to model
nucleotide sequences without knowledge of predetermined sequence structures. Our 
experiments show that training a RNN-based nucleotide sequence model is efficient
and RNN-based bias correction methods compare well with the-state-of-the-art
sequence-specific bias correction method on the commonly used MAQC-III data set.
CONCLUSTIONS: RNNs provides an alternative and flexible way to calculate
sequence-specific bias without explicitly pre-determining sequence structures.
