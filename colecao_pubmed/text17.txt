Applications of Deep Learning in Biomedicine.

Increases in throughput and installed base of biomedical research equipment led
to a massive accumulation of -omics data known to be highly variable,
high-dimensional, and sourced from multiple often incompatible data platforms.
While this data may be useful for biomarker identification and drug discovery,
the bulk of it remains underutilized. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are efficient
algorithms based on the use of compositional layers of neurons, with advantages
well matched to the challenges -omics data presents. While achieving
state-of-the-art results and even surpassing human accuracy in many challenging
tasks, the adoption of deep learning in biomedicine has been comparatively slow. 
Here, we discuss key features of deep learning that may give this approach an
edge over other machine learning methods. We then consider limitations and review
a number of applications of deep learning in biomedical studies demonstrating
proof of concept and practical utility.
