HLA class I binding prediction via convolutional neural networks.

Motivation: Many biological processes are governed by protein-ligand
interactions. One such example is the recognition of self and nonself cells by
the immune system. This immune response process is regulated by the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein which is encoded by the human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) complex. Understanding the binding potential between MHC and
peptides can lead to the design of more potent, peptide-based vaccines and
immunotherapies for infectious autoimmune diseases.
Results: We apply machine learning techniques from the natural language
processing (NLP) domain to address the task of MHC-peptide binding prediction.
More specifically, we introduce a new distributed representation of amino acids, 
name HLA-Vec, that can be used for a variety of downstream proteomic machine
learning tasks. We then propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture,
name HLA-CNN, for the task of HLA class I-peptide binding prediction.
Experimental results show combining the new distributed representation with our
HLA-CNN architecture acheives state-of-the-art results in the majority of the
latest two Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) weekly automated benchmark datasets. We
further apply our model to predict binding on the human genome and identify 15
genes with potential for self binding.
