Atlas Regeneration, Inc.

Atlas Regeneration is dedicated to the development of novel data-driven solutions
for regenerative medicine, adapting proven technologies, and analysis strategies 
to take a multiomics-wide view of stem cell quality and cell fate design. Our
core offering is a global comprehensive map of stem cell differentiation,
Universal Signalome Atlas for Regenerative Medicine, reflecting the pathway
activation states across all characterized stem cells and their differentiated
products. Key applications of Universal Signalome Atlas for Regenerative Medicine
will include quality assurance for engineered cell products, and directed
regeneration pharmacology, where we will screen and identify compounds that can
efficiently convert pluripotent cells into desired subtypes. Another marketable
piece of IP is development of specialized signaling pathway analysis systems
Regeneration Intelligence which supposed to target the unmet needs of
determination and prediction of stem cell signaling pathway activation to govern 
cell differentiation in specific directions.
