A multi-resolution approach for spinal metastasis detection using deep Siamese
neural networks.

Spinal metastasis, a metastatic cancer of the spine, is the most common malignant
disease in the spine. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of automated 
spinal metastasis detection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by using deep
learning methods. To accommodate the large variability in metastatic lesion
sizes, we develop a Siamese deep neural network approach comprising three
identical subnetworks for multi-resolution analysis and detection of spinal
metastasis. At each location of interest, three image patches at three different 
resolutions are extracted and used as the input to the networks. To further
reduce the false positives (FPs), we leverage the similarity between neighboring 
MRI slices, and adopt a weighted averaging strategy to aggregate the results
obtained by the Siamese neural networks. The detection performance is evaluated
on a set of 26 cases using a free-response receiver operating characteristic
(FROC) analysis. The results show that the proposed approach correctly detects
all the spinal metastatic lesions while producing only 0.40 FPs per case. At a
true positive (TP) rate of 90%, the use of the aggregation reduces the FPs from
0.375 FPs per case to 0.207 FPs per case, a nearly 44.8% reduction. The results
indicate that the proposed Siamese neural network method, combined with the
aggregation strategy, provide a viable strategy for the automated detection of
spinal metastasis in MRI images.
