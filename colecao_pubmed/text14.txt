Basset: learning the regulatory code of the accessible genome with deep
convolutional neural networks.

The complex language of eukaryotic gene expression remains incompletely
understood. Despite the importance suggested by many noncoding variants
statistically associated with human disease, nearly all such variants have
unknown mechanisms. Here, we address this challenge using an approach based on a 
recent machine learning advance-deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We
introduce the open source package Basset to apply CNNs to learn the functional
activity of DNA sequences from genomics data. We trained Basset on a compendium
of accessible genomic sites mapped in 164 cell types by DNase-seq, and
demonstrate greater predictive accuracy than previous methods. Basset predictions
for the change in accessibility between variant alleles were far greater for
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs that are likely to be causal relative
to nearby SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with them. With Basset, a researcher can
perform a single sequencing assay in their cell type of interest and
simultaneously learn that cell's chromatin accessibility code and annotate every 
mutation in the genome with its influence on present accessibility and latent
potential for accessibility. Thus, Basset offers a powerful computational
approach to annotate and interpret the noncoding genome.
