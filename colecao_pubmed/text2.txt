Deep learning for healthcare: review, opportunities and challenges.

Gaining knowledge and actionable insights from complex, high-dimensional and
heterogeneous biomedical data remains a key challenge in transforming health
care. Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research,
including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which
are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured.
Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to
first perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features
from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them.
There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and 
lacking of sufficient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning
technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-to-end learning models
from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying
deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the
analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for 
translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note
limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications,
especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen
scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and
meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human
interpretability.
