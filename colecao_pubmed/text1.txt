A computational approach for the functional classification of the epigenome.

BACKGROUND: In the last decade, advanced functional genomics approaches and deep 
sequencing have allowed large-scale mapping of histone modifications and other
epigenetic marks, highlighting functional relationships between chromatin
organization and genome function. Here, we propose a novel approach to explore
functional interactions between different epigenetic modifications and extract
combinatorial profiles that can be used to annotate the chromatin in a finite
number of functional classes. Our method is based on non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF), an unsupervised learning technique originally employed to
decompose high-dimensional data in a reduced number of meaningful patterns. We
applied the NMF algorithm to a set of different epigenetic marks, consisting of
ChIP-seq assays for multiple histone modifications, Pol II binding and chromatin 
accessibility assays from human H1 cells.
RESULTS: We identified a number of chromatin profiles that contain functional
information and are biologically interpretable. We also observe that epigenetic
profiles are characterized by specific genomic contexts and show significant
association with distinct genomic features. Moreover, analysis of RNA-seq data
reveals that distinct chromatin signatures correlate with the level of gene
expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study highlights the utility of NMF in studying
functional relationships between different epigenetic modifications and may
provide new biological insights for the interpretation of the chromatin dynamics.
