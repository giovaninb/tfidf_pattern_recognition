Deep Patient: An Unsupervised Representation to Predict the Future of Patients
from the Electronic Health Records.

Secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to advance clinical
research and better inform clinical decision making. Challenges in summarizing
and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling 
using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to 
derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates
clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising
autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in
the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data
warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated
this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the
probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation
using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains
and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using
representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning
strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and
various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep 
learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved
clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for
augmenting clinical decision systems.
