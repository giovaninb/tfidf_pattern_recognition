Spinal poly-GA inclusions in a C9orf72 mouse model trigger motor deficits and
inflammation without neuron loss.

Translation of the expanded (ggggcc)n repeat in C9orf72 patients with amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) causes abundant poly-GA
inclusions. To elucidate their role in pathogenesis, we generated transgenic mice
expressing codon-modified (GA)149 conjugated with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP).
Transgenic mice progressively developed poly-GA inclusions predominantly in
motoneurons and interneurons of the spinal cord and brain stem and in deep
cerebellar nuclei. Poly-GA co-aggregated with p62, Rad23b and the newly
identified Mlf2, in both mouse and patient samples. Consistent with the
expression pattern, 4-month-old transgenic mice showed abnormal gait and
progressive balance impairment, but showed normal hippocampus-dependent learning 
and memory. Apart from microglia activation we detected phosphorylated TDP-43 but
no neuronal loss. Thus, poly-GA triggers behavioral deficits through inflammation
and protein sequestration that likely contribute to the prodromal symptoms and
disease progression of C9orf72 patients.
